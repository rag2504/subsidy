# üß™ Complete Testing Guide - Blockchain Integration

## üö® **CRITICAL: Fix Setup Issues First**

### **Issue 1: Hardhat Dependencies**
The contracts folder has dependency conflicts. Let's fix this:

```bash
# Remove the problematic contracts folder
rm -rf contracts/

# Create a fresh contracts setup
mkdir contracts
cd contracts
```

### **Issue 2: Create Simple Hardhat Setup**
Create `contracts/package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "gh2-subsidy-contracts",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "compile": "hardhat compile",
    "node": "hardhat node",
    "deploy": "hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "hardhat": "^2.19.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.9.6",
    "ethers": "^5.7.2"
  }
}
```

Create `contracts/hardhat.config.js`:
```javascript
/** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.20",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {},
    localhost: {
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:8545"
    }
  }
};
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Step-by-Step Setup**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Root dependencies
npm install

# Contracts dependencies
cd contracts
npm install
```

### **Step 2: Compile Contracts**
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat compile
```

### **Step 3: Start Local Blockchain**
```bash
# Keep this terminal open
npx hardhat node
```

### **Step 4: Deploy Contract**
In a new terminal:
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

**Copy the contract address** - you'll need it for environment variables.

### **Step 5: Get Private Keys**
From the Hardhat node output, copy:
- **Account #0** private key (for GOV_PRIVATE_KEY)
- **Account #1** private key (for AUDITOR_PRIVATE_KEY)

### **Step 6: Configure Environment**
Create `server/.env`:
```env
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/subsidy

# JWT Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret-here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Blockchain Configuration
CHAIN_RPC=http://127.0.0.1:8545
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x... # from hardhat deploy
GOV_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...  # from hardhat account #0
AUDITOR_PRIVATE_KEY=0x... # from hardhat account #1

# Email Configuration (optional for demo)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=no-reply@subsidy.gov

# Payment Gateway (optional for demo)
CASHFREE_API_URL=https://api.cashfree.com/pg
CASHFREE_APP_ID=your-cashfree-app-id
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=your-cashfree-secret-key

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
PING_MESSAGE=pong
```

### **Step 7: Create Required Directories**
```bash
mkdir -p server/uploads
mkdir -p server/receipts
```

## üöÄ **Running the Application**

### **Step 1: Start Blockchain (if not already running)**
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat node
```

### **Step 2: Start Server**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

### **Step 3: Start Client**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

## üß™ **Complete End-to-End Testing**

### **Test 1: Government Operations**
1. **Open Browser**: Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Navigate to Gov Tab**
3. **Login**: Use `gov@subsidy.gov` / `gov-secure-2024`
4. **Create Program**:
   - Name: "GH2 Subsidy Program"
   - Currency: "USD"
5. **Create Project**:
   - Program: Select the created program
   - Name: "Solar Farm Project"
   - Email: "producer@example.com"
6. **Define Milestone**:
   - Key: "M1"
   - Title: "Install Solar Panels"
   - Amount: 10000
   - Unit: "panels"

### **Test 2: Producer Operations**
1. **Navigate to Producer Tab**
2. **Enter Email**: `producer@example.com`
3. **Complete OTP**: Use the dev OTP shown in console
4. **Apply for Project**: Select the created project
5. **Verify**: Check that application is submitted

### **Test 3: Auditor Operations**
1. **Navigate to Auditor Tab**
2. **Login**: Use `auditor@subsidy.gov` / `audit-secure-2024`
3. **Select Project**: Choose the approved project
4. **Select Milestone**: Choose M1
5. **Upload Evidence**: Create a test file (PDF, image, etc.)
6. **Fill Form**:
   - Value: 5000
   - Deadline: Leave default (1 hour from now)
   - Nonce: 1
7. **Submit Attestation**: Click "Submit Attestation"
8. **Verify**: Check for transaction hash in response

### **Test 4: Payment Release**
1. **Go back to Gov Tab**
2. **Find Attested Milestone**: Should show as attested
3. **Trigger Release**:
   - Project ID: (auto-filled)
   - Milestone: M1
   - Amount: 5000
   - Rail: Bank
4. **Click Queue**: Should return transaction hash
5. **Verify**: Check blockchain events

## üîç **Verification Steps**

### **Check Smart Contract Events**
In the Hardhat node terminal, you should see:
```
Attested(milestoneId: 0x..., attestor: 0x..., value: 5000, dataHash: 0x...)
Released(milestoneId: 0x..., amount: 5000, bankRef: 0x...)
```

### **Check Transaction Hashes**
- All attestations and releases return transaction hashes
- These can be verified on the blockchain

### **Check Database Records**
- MongoDB should contain project, milestone, and attestation records
- Each record should have transaction hash references

## üêõ **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: "CONTRACT_ADDRESS missing"**
- Ensure you copied the address from hardhat deploy
- Check that the address starts with "0x"

### **Issue 2: "Invalid private key"**
- Ensure private keys start with "0x"
- Copy the full private key from hardhat node output

### **Issue 3: "Network error"**
- Ensure hardhat node is running
- Check CHAIN_RPC points to correct endpoint

### **Issue 4: "File upload failed"**
- Ensure uploads/ directory exists
- Check file permissions

### **Issue 5: "Compilation failed"**
- Check Solidity version compatibility
- Ensure all imports are available

## üìä **Expected Results**

### **Successful Test Flow**
1. ‚úÖ Government creates program and project
2. ‚úÖ Producer applies successfully
3. ‚úÖ Auditor uploads evidence and submits attestation
4. ‚úÖ Smart contract records attestation event
5. ‚úÖ Government triggers payment release
6. ‚úÖ Smart contract records release event
7. ‚úÖ Transaction hashes are returned
8. ‚úÖ Database records are updated

### **Security Verification**
- ‚úÖ Only authorized roles can perform actions
- ‚úÖ File hashes are computed correctly
- ‚úÖ EIP-712 signatures are valid
- ‚úÖ Nonce protection prevents replay attacks
- ‚úÖ One-time payout enforcement works

## üéØ **Demo Script for Judges**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
"Welcome to our blockchain-powered subsidy management system. This demonstrates how we can use smart contracts to ensure transparency and prevent fraud in government subsidy programs."

### **Government Setup (1 minute)**
"First, let me show you how government officials create subsidy programs and approve projects. Notice how everything is role-based and secure."

### **Producer Application (30 seconds)**
"Here's how producers apply for subsidies using simple email verification. No complex passwords needed."

### **Auditor Verification (1 minute)**
"This is the key innovation. Auditors upload evidence files, which are cryptographically hashed and signed. The attestation is recorded on the blockchain with EIP-712 signatures."

### **Payment Release (30 seconds)**
"Finally, government officials can release payments only after attestation. The smart contract enforces one-time payouts and amount limits."

### **Verification (30 seconds)**
"Let me show you the transaction hashes and blockchain events. Everything is publicly verifiable and tamper-proof."

### **Closing (30 seconds)**
"This transforms subsidy management from a trust-based system to a cryptographically verified, transparent, and automated system that prevents fraud and ensures accountability."

## üöÄ **Production Readiness Checklist**
